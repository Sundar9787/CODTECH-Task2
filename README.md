## Overview of the Project

### Project: Second Hand Car Prediction using Linear Regression

### Objective
This repository contains the code and analysis for  building a linear regression model to predict prices of second-hand cars. The goal is to understand the dataset, explore its structure, visualize various aspects, and develop a predictive model.

### Key Activities
- **Data Loading**: Loading the dataset and performing initial data inspection.
- **Data Cleaning**: Ensuring the dataset is free from inconsistencies and missing values.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features to improve the predictive power of the model and encoding categorical variables.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating visualizations to understand data distributions, trends, and relationships.
- **Model Building**: Developing a linear regression model to predict car prices based on various features.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the model using appropriate metrics.
- **Custom Predictions**: Testing the model with custom input values to predict car prices.

### Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language for data analysis and model building.
- **pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy**: Utilized for numerical operations.
- **matplotlib**: Employed for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **scikit-learn**: Used for data preprocessing, building, and evaluating the linear regression model.


### Key Insights
- **Data Distributions**: Histograms and descriptive statistics to understand the distribution of car prices and other features.
- **Feature Importance**: Analysis to determine which features are most influential in predicting car prices.
- **Model Performance**: Metrics such as MSE and R-squared to evaluate the modelâ€™s accuracy.
- **Correlation Patterns**: Heatmaps to display the correlation between different features, highlighting significant trends and patterns.

This project provides a comprehensive overview of second-hand car price trends and insights, useful for further studies or market analysis. The linear regression model developed can serve as a baseline for more complex predictive models in the future.
